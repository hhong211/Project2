        "Based on the results, the toxicity scores of ironic comments are very low. Some of them I think sound a little bit like a toxic comment and I guess it could be higher than 0.5 but it didn’t.  However, four ironic comments got a score higher than 0.1, which means they were seen as slightly toxic. For example, the comment about the phone dying at the worst possible time got a high score. This might be because the system thought the word \"dies\" was negative, as it's often used in bad situations. Also, the comment \"crashed my car?\" could have been marked as toxic because crashes are usually bad news. The comment about getting a 25 on an exam and always being a disappointment probably got a high score because being called \"disappointing\" is not a nice thing. Lastly, the comment about smoking inside might have been seen as more toxic because it talks about \"smoking\" and \"burnt tobacco,\" which are related to negative health effects. Although I didn't expect the model can detect non-obvious sarcasm. Like the comment \"Great job on your report, it's not like facts are important anyway.\" which I think meaning seems to be an obvious sarcastic comment, its toxicity score is only 0.012.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, the comments with straightforwardly toxic garner significantly higher toxicity scores. All of these comments have toxicity scores higher than 0.5. The comment 'Shut up, you idiot, nobody cares about your opinion.' got the highest score of 0.9288, probably because it combines a direct insult with a complete dismissal of the individual’s viewpoint. The comment 'You are a pathetic loser, and everyone knows it.' got a third-highest score of 0.8533,  likely due to the direct and unambiguous insults it contains. The remaining comments all contain straightforward personal attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "These results indicate that the model we use to measure toxicity in comments can only pick up on negative words and mark comments as toxic because of them. This happens even if the comments are meant to be funny or sarcastic. The problem is that this model could not understand when the meaning changes because of how something is said or the situation it's said. This shows that the model isn't perfect and doesn't completely get the way humans talk to each other, especially when it comes to sarcasm or irony."
